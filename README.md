<h3 align="center>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h3>

<p align = "center">
Trivia Quiz is a project built in Javascript. It uses a JSON file of questions and their answer choices (including the correct answers), gets ten random questions, and 
displays the questions and answer choices (which have been shuffled) to the user. After each question, the user is informed whether or not their answer is correct. If 
the answer is incorrect, the correct answer will appear below the answer choices. After the quiz is submitted, the user will be able to see their score and start over with 
a new batch of questions.
